== StateWalker will simplify the coding of your (complex) state machines.

Statewalker implements a hierarchical state pattern variant by using a *stack* of states.
It uses Java 8 features and works with Java 8 and up.

Statewalker is also about testable design, in particular testing stateful behaviour. Using Mockito to mock Context and Device
will let you set up your tests very easily and achieve full coverage of the state behaviour implementation in the state enum.

The class diagram below shows the typical usage of statewalker, with its three main parts, *ContextBase*, *Device*, and *StateBase*.

Note that the design uses _generics_ in a way that involves all three, `<C,D,S>` for Context, Device, and State.
It makes the design a bit harder to realise but usage bothy type safe and simpler.

An example of such a hierarchical state machine can be seen in the figure below <<StateDiagram>>.

Stack wise, The child-most state is on top of all, in particular it's super state (if any) below it and so on.
To change a state the code typically uses one method: `changeFromToState(String message, State from, State... to)`.

The source code and the separate `statewalkertest` project can be found on github at the url https://github.com/sebivenlo/statewalker[https://github.com/sebivenlo/statewalker].

=== Apply it to your project:

To make it work in your project, you have to do some work yourselves.

. Implement a Context that extends `BaseContext` like the code below.
. Extend a `State` interface with default method handlers for ALL events (methods) relevant to your state machine.
. Have a `StateEnum` implement this State interface. Since the interface has default methods only, a state only has to overwrite
 any method that is relevant to this state.
. You will also need a _Device_ that can be asked from the context and can be manipulated (as in: call methods on it) in the states. One or more devices
 are typically the reason to have a state machine in the first place. the *Device* is the combination of all things that can be turned on and off and serve
 a common goal, such as brewing coffee at 6:00 in the morning.

What the 'device' is and what it can do is up to you. For a coffee machine it would be the boiler and the lights. For an elevator the door motor and elevator motor, lights etc.

=== The Context
[source,java]
----
class Context extends ContextBase<Context, Dev, State> {

  public Context( Class<?> stateClass ) {
          super( stateClass );
  }

  void e2() {
        getTopState().e2( this );
  } //etc
}
----

=== State interface

The major part of the concept is using default methods, provided since Java 8. Abstract (or non-abstract) would
also work, but

* you can only extend one class, so it would limit your design options and
* you cannot have an `enum` extend a class, only `implement` interfaces.

[source,java]
----
include::{sourcedir}/State.java[]

As you can see all but the pseudo events reach the event (i.e. method call) down to the next state (the super-state) on the state stack.

Then have an enum implement this interface and give it at least  a `NULL` value,
which is placed on the bottom of the stack, will never be removed and is there
to catch any event not handled by any of the sub states. This NULL is then the catch all  implementation that does nothing.
You could have NULL log received events, but not have it reaching down any.

Explanation:

<1> Turns the heater on on entry.
<2> Turns the heater off on exit.
<3> Changes state to S31, implicitly leaving this state which should automagically call exit on `this` state, which is `S33` and thus turns off the heater.

public class Dev implements Device<Context, Dev, State> {

For an example see the maven project statewalkertest in the repository, which implements the state bahavior in the <<StateDiagram>> below:
